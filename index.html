        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>In 1911, electricity tycoon Lucien Lucius (L.L.) Nunn founded
            the Telluride Association, consisting of a self-governing household on the Cornell campus run by alumni of Nunn’s engineering projects. The students served on the board of trustees and
            were expected to govern their own affairs. Over the next few
            years, Nunn further developed the educational philosophy of
            the Telluride model, and, in 1917, founded Deep Springs College on an isolated ranch in the White Mountains. In the last decade, four other schools have been built on these
            three pillars of Self-Governance, Labor, and Academics, each
            with its own spin on the Nunnian model. Located across the
            county, from Massachusetts to Alaska, these schools are at the
            forefront of holistic education, developing their students’ character along with their minds. Together these Six institutions make up the League of Nunnian Schools.</p>
